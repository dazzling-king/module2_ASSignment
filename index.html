  <h2>Quiche</h2>
  <div>Making a quiche is actually surprisingly easy. We lay out some simple tips below. Follow along with Chef John as he makes a Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon, leeks, and Gruyere cheese. To see how to make quiche crust, check out Chef John's Easy Homemade Crust.If you're adding onions, leeks, or other chopped veggies, give them a quick saute.Prep your deep-dish pie pan (or tart pan) with pie dough for a single crust. We're going to "blind bake" the quiche crust before pouring in the filling.To blind bake the crust, line your crust with aluminum foil, shaping it so it fits the crust, all the way to the edges. To weigh down the foil, fill the foil with dried beans, distributing them across the bottom and partly up the sides. The weight helps hold the crust's shape.</div>
